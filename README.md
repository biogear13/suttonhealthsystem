# Sutton health system

## Project Description
I had been in Sutton, London for almost 2 years now as of time of writing and I am a little disappointed that I have yet to learn the health system not just here in Sutton but in the entirety of UK. Since I envision myself to take on jobs inside the health care system and I have a budding passion in all things data, I started this project to create a repository of all the data that are freely available on the internet regarding Sutton, London. These would include data on health care providers in the government, private and volunteer sectors, demographic data and health outcomes.
